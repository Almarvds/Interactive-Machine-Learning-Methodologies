# Interactive-Machine-Learning-Methodologies
This repository features an application that explores methods for interactive machine learning.

The different methodologies can be found under the different branches of the project. 
As such it is important to remember that the master and dev branch are not used in their traditional manner. (and should not be used for the final build)
