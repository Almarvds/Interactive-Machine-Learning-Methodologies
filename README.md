# Interactive-Machine-Learning-Methodologies
This repository features an application that explores methods for interactive machine learning.

The different methodologies can be found under the different branches of the project. 
As such it is important to remember that the master and dev branch are not used in their traditional manner. (and should not be used for the final build)

This project was developed using the Intellij IDE and makes use of the processing API.
The processing API can be downloaded right here: https://processing.org/download/

To get the methods to work, make sure to:
1. Download the processing IDE.
2. Add the processing library to the project.
3. add the project as an artifact in your IDE.
4. Build from that artifact.

Thank you for reading and showing interest in this project.
